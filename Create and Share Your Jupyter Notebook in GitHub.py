# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
# 
# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
# 
# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# - Python
#  - Julia
#  - R
#  - Java
#  - Swift
#  - C/C++
#  - SQL
# 
#  Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
#  - TensorFlow.
#  - NumPy.
#  - SciPy.
#  - Pandas.
#  - Matplotlib.
#  - Keras.
#  - SciKit-Learn.
#  - PyTorch

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[7]:


result1 = 7-5
print (result1)

result2 = 7+5
print (result2)

result3 = 7*5
print (result3)


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.

# In[9]:


result = (3*4)+5
print (result)


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[16]:


minutes = 200
hours=minutes/60
print(hours)
